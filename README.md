# Swarm Tank Simulation

A sophisticated swarm intelligence simulation featuring autonomous bots with different roles, predator-prey dynamics, and emergent behaviors.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– **Bot Roles & Behaviors**
- **Harvesters** (Magenta): Collect food, reproduce when well-fed
- **Warriors** (Purple): Defend the swarm, attack predators, taunt enemies
- **Scouts** (Cyan): Fast scouts that find food and alert others
- **Drones** (Blue): Maintain formation and swarm cohesion
- **Leaders** (Yellow): Guide swarm movement and formation

### ðŸ”´ **Predator System**
- **Health System**: Predators start at 50% health, gain health from kills
- **Combat**: Warriors can damage predators in close combat
- **Mortality**: Predators die from starvation or damage
- **Food Drops**: Dead predators drop 3-5 food items
- **Visual Indicators**: Health bars and kill count display

### âš¡ **Power-Up System**
- **Swarm-Wide Buffs**: Power-ups affect the entire swarm
- **Speed Boost**: +50% movement speed for 5 seconds
- **Damage Boost**: Double damage for warriors for 5 seconds
- **Energy Boost**: Restores energy to collector only
- **Visual Effects**: Pulsing rings around buffed bots

### ðŸ§¬ **Reproduction System**
- **Harvester Reproduction**: High-energy harvesters can reproduce near food
- **Genetic Inheritance**: New bots inherit active swarm buffs
- **Population Control**: Energy cost and cooldown prevent overpopulation
- **Role Diversity**: Offspring can be any role with harvester bias

### ðŸŽ® **Interactive Controls**
- **Space**: Spawn 8 food items
- **P**: Spawn random power-up
- **B**: Manually spawn a new bot
- **Escape**: Quit game

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pygame

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swarm-tank.git
cd swarm-tank

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulation
python swarm_tank.py
```

## Game Mechanics

### **Swarm Behaviors**
- **Separation**: Avoid crowding with nearby bots
- **Alignment**: Match velocity with neighbors
- **Cohesion**: Move toward average position of neighbors
- **Food Seeking**: Prioritize food collection
- **Predator Avoidance**: Enhanced fear response to threats

### **Role-Specific Abilities**
- **Scouts**: Shout food locations to nearby bots
- **Warriors**: Taunt predators and deal combat damage
- **Harvesters**: Burst speed near food, reproduction capability
- **Drones**: Strong cohesion for formation maintenance
- **Leaders**: Balanced stats for group coordination

### **Ecosystem Balance**
- **Food Spawning**: Automatic spawning with scarcity protection
- **Predator Lifecycle**: Dynamic population with respawn mechanics
- **Energy Management**: Bots consume energy and die if starved
- **Reproduction**: Population growth balanced by predation

## Technical Details

### **Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Separate files for different components
- **Vector Math**: Custom 2D vector class for physics
- **Role System**: Data-driven bot role configuration
- **Entity System**: Polymorphic food, power-ups, and predators

### **Performance**
- **60 FPS**: Smooth real-time simulation
- **Efficient Collision**: Optimized distance calculations
